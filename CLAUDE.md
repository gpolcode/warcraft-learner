# warcraft-learner

A web-based diagnostic tool for Mythic WoW raiders: it evaluates Warcraft Logs combat data against AI-generated, spec-specific rulebooks and delivers coaching-style feedback benchmarked against top parses. The app is a **fully static Angular SPA** on GitHub Pages - no backend, all analysis client-side, WCL queried directly from the browser with an OAuth2 client-credentials token (no user login).

## How this file works

This file is the always-on **router**: the few rules that apply on every turn, plus a table that tells you which **skill** to load before each kind of work. The detailed conventions (frontend, architecture, testing, ingestion, WCL/data, copy/branding) live in skills under `.claude/skills/` and load **on demand** - so each task only pulls in the context it needs. Load the matching skill before you start; do not work from memory of a topic that has a skill.

## Always-on rules

- **Never use em-dashes (U+2014) or en-dashes (U+2013)** anywhere - not in docs, code comments, commit messages, UI copy, or generated output. Also avoid the Unicode minus (U+2212). Use a plain ASCII hyphen (`-`) for ranges and parenthetical asides, or rephrase. This applies to every file in the repo and any text the tooling emits.
- **Describe only current behavior, never past behavior.** Documentation, skill files, and code comments MUST describe what the code does now, not what it used to do, what was removed, or how it changed. Never write "the old code...", "previously...", "was removed", "no longer...", "used to...", or contrast against a prior approach ("X instead of the old Y", "not the absolute-clock target anymore"). Describing what is no longer there is noise. State the current behavior directly; the change history lives in git, commit messages, and PR descriptions, not in the source or docs.

(Both rules stay here because they govern all output, not just one kind of work - everything else is in a skill.)

## Architecture at a glance

The app is built as **per-use-case vertical slices** (rotation / burst / defensive / gear / map / live), functional-core / imperative-shell, fed by exactly **two pass-through API services** at runtime (`WclApiService`, `DataFileApiService`). Two symmetric pipelines meet at the static data files in `frontend/public/data/specs/**`. The `live` slice (`pages/post-raid/live/`) is the exception to the data pipeline: it owns the live-sync + screen-recording toggles and the per-window clip replay (a `getDisplayMedia` rolling buffer + browser-only `ClipStore`), so it reads no bench data and writes nothing outside the browser.

```
INGEST (Node, scripts/ingest)            RUNTIME (browser, Angular)
WclApi -> *TransformService -> DataFileApi  ->  data/specs/**  ->  DataFileApiService
                                                                   -> *DataSource (token swap)
                                                                   -> *FeatureService -> *Component
                                                                   -> page shell -> leaves
```

Ingestion runs the **same** `*TransformService`s the browser uses, headlessly. The full directory map, the hard layer rules, and the data-flow diagram are in the **warcraft-architecture** skill.

```
frontend/        # the entire Angular 22 app
  src/app/pages/ # post-raid (/, incl. the live/ slice: live-sync + recording toggles, clip replay), pre-fight (/pre)
  src/app/core/  # the two API services, data-source token, models
  scripts/ingest # ingestion orchestrator + discovery helpers (run via tsx)
  public/data/specs/  # static ingested data (slices, encounters, positions, rulebooks) - NOT tracked on main; see below
.github/workflows/  # deploy-pages, ingest-parses (hourly), pr-preview, test
.claude/skills/   # on-demand skills (rulebook schema in warcraft-ingestion/, generation in warcraft-rulebook/)
```

The ~100 MB of minified bench data under `frontend/public/data/specs/**` is **not tracked on `main`** (gitignored). The deployed site is composed on **`gh-pages`** from disjoint single-owner folders at the site root: `data/specs/` (shared dataset, written by `ingest-parses`), `main/` (prod shell, `deploy-pages`), `pr-N/` (per-PR shells, `pr-preview`); a root `index.html` redirects to `/main/`. Every environment ships only the shell and reads the one shared dataset via an absolute `dataBaseHref`, so code deploys never re-push data. The three writers share one `gh-pages` concurrency group (serialized single-commit force-pushes). `pr-preview` rebuilds all open PRs and clean-replaces the root `pr-*` dirs (a static `clean-exclude` guards `main`/`data`/root files), so closed previews vanish structurally (no cleanup workflow). Local dev: `npm run data:pull` (from `frontend/`) fetches the data from `origin/gh-pages`.

## Commands (run from `frontend/`)

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm start` | Angular dev server on http://localhost:4200 |
| `npm run build` | Production build to `../static/angular/` |
| `npm test` | `ng test` (frontend Vitest) + scripts Vitest + scripts typecheck |
| `npm run lint` | `ng lint` over `src/**` then `eslint scripts` over `scripts/**` |
| `npm run ingest` | Run the ingestion orchestrator (needs `WCL_CLIENT_ID`/`WCL_CLIENT_SECRET`) |

## Development workflow router

Load the matching skill(s) **before** you start that step. The `warcraft-*` skills are this project's rules; `angular-developer` and `solid` are generic references (project rules win on conflict); `/code-review`, `/simplify`, `/verify`, `/run` are built-in skills.

| When you are... | Load before you start |
|---|---|
| Planning / scoping any change | the `Plan` agent + **warcraft-architecture** (+ the domain skill for the area) |
| Designing / building Angular UI (components, templates, styling, pipes, services) | **angular-developer** + **warcraft-frontend** |
| Writing user-facing copy, findings, microcopy, or anything branded (titles, nav, banners, READMEs, favicon) | **warcraft-copy** |
| Working on a vertical slice, a transform, analysis math, or layer boundaries | **warcraft-architecture** |
| Touching WCL queries, gear / spec / talent / enchant extraction, positions, or `wcl-auth` / the embedded secret | **warcraft-wcl-data** |
| Working on the live slice (live-sync, screen recording, the clip replay flyover) | **warcraft-frontend** + **warcraft-architecture** |
| Generating or refreshing a spec's `rulebook.json` (one, some, or all specs) | **warcraft-rulebook** |
| Ingestion, `data/specs` file shapes, rulebook consumption/schema, or `INGEST_VERSION` | **warcraft-ingestion** |
| Writing or changing tests | **warcraft-testing** |
| General refactor / code-quality cleanup | **solid** + `/simplify` (project rules win on conflict) |
| Reviewing code, a diff, or a PR | `/code-review` + **solid** + the domain skill(s) for the changed area |
| Verifying a change runs / manual end-to-end check | `/verify` or `/run` |

On any conflict between a skill and this file, or between a generic skill (`angular-developer`, `solid`) and a `warcraft-*` project skill, the **project skill / this file wins**.
