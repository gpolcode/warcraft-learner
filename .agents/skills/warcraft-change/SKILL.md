# warcraft-learner change

**What good looks like:** a change is playable end to end - the analysis computes it, ingestion bakes it, the page renders it, the copy coaches it, and a spec pins it. Testing is not a phase; it is part of the deliverable.

**Deliverable:** the checklist below holds for your diff, the self-review checklist passes, and `npm test` + `npm run lint` + `npm run build` pass.

## Universal checklist

Every change delivers some subset of:

1. **Slice math** - named, stateless methods: protected on the slice's facade service, or public on a `domain/` service. Methods take data in and return data; IO stays behind the two API services.
2. **Bench shape** - if the change alters what ingestion must bake, update the slice's `*Bench` interface in its `data-access/*-data-source.ts` and bump `INGEST_VERSION` (`src/app/features/raid-analysis/ingest/domain/ingest-version.ts`).
3. **Failure handling** - every fallible load returns `Result<T, LoadError>`; the four render states (content / waiting / transient error / permanent error). No silent swallow.
4. **UI** - template owns styling off the `styles.scss` tokens, formatting goes through pipes, drill-down uses `wl-finding-occurrences`.
5. **Copy** - message + remedy in the terse analyst voice. Governing skill: **warcraft-writing**.
6. **Specs** - pure math tested at the lowest altitude, services end-to-end through fakes. Each "triggers" case paired with a "does not trigger at the boundary" case.
7. **WCL reads** - a new event stream or gear/talent/position field means checking the quirks table first. Governing skill: **warcraft-wcl-data**.

## Change kinds

### New finding on an existing slice

Deliver: the pure check in the slice's colocated functions, a `FindingOccurrence`-populated result, message + remedy copy, boundary-paired specs. No bench change means no `INGEST_VERSION` bump.

### New rule-engine kind

Deliver: the kind's class in `rotation-rules/kinds/` extending `RuleKind` - or `BoundedPerCastKind` / `FillerKind` for the shared evaluators - registered in `KIND_CLASSES` (`rotation-rules/rule-kinds.ts`; the mapped type will not compile with one missing), per-instance `occurrences` on the finding, boundary-paired specs. The kind must also be declared in the rulebook schema (`.agents/skills/warcraft-rulebook/rulebook.schema.json`) - bump `INGEST_VERSION`.

### New vertical slice

Follow the Burst slice (`features/raid-analysis/burst-windows/`) as the reference. Deliver: the slice's `*TransformService` + `*DataSource` token pair in `data-access/`, its `*FeatureService` in `facade/`, the feature component in `components/`, slice-local math in `domain/`, wired into the ingest orchestrator and the page shell, its tailored bench file, specs at both altitudes. Bump `INGEST_VERSION`.

### New page or shared component

Deliver: the shell (zero domain services) or leaf (inputs/outputs only), copy per **warcraft-writing**, specs per the testing rules below, and - for a page - an e2e card test per the e2e rules below.

## Architecture rules (hard)

- **Exactly two pass-through API services at runtime** - `WclApiService` and `DataFileApiService`. Bytes in, typed bytes out.
- **Services are self-contained**: inject only the two API services (or the slice `*DataSource` token), domain services, and `LoggerService`; import models. A facade owns its slice-local math as protected methods or delegates to the slice's `domain/` service. The method shape itself is eslint-enforced (`no-function-alias-members` plus the exported-function ban, whose `ignores` list the sanctioned exceptions).
- **`*DataSource` interface + `*_DATA_SOURCE` InjectionToken** - the only swap point between production (`*DataFileService`) and development/ingest (`*TransformService`).
- **`*FeatureService`** - the runtime shell, one per feature component, in the slice's `facade/`. Injects its token + the cached `WclApiService` + domain services, exposes signals; its public members are the component's surface.
- **Feature components inject their `*FeatureService`** plus shared UI services (`LoadResourceService`, `FindingRowsService`) - never a domain service.
- **Page shells - zero domain services.** Resolve selection, compose feature components, pass selection as inputs.
- **Presentational leaves - inputs/outputs only**, no services beyond framework tokens.

## UI rules (hard)

- **Styling is Angular Material + Tailwind utilities over `frontend/src/styles.scss`** - the one stylesheet, holding the design tokens and the `badge-*` / `fill-*` / `icon-*` / `chip-onplan` classes.
- **Templates and `styles.scss` reach a color through a token** - a Tailwind arbitrary value (`text-[var(--success)]`) or a `badge-*` class.
- **`computed()` exposes semantic state only**; the template maps that state to a class.
- **All formatting goes through Angular pipes** (`FormatDurationPipe`, `FormatDamagePipe`, `DecimalPipe`, `FormatSpecPipe`).
- **A rule finding's drill-down is `wl-finding-occurrences`** (`shared/components/finding-table/`): populate `occurrences` on the finding and the UI work is done.

## Failure-handling rules (hard)

- Every fallible load returns `Result<T, LoadError>` - never `T | null`, never an escaping throw.
- The error channel is the three-variant `LoadError` union: `missing` (404, not an error), `transient` (network/5xx, retried once by the interceptor), `permanent` (200 but semantically unusable, carries an `id` and is `logWarn`ed).
- `try/catch` lives only in the imperative shell; the catch `logWarn`s then returns `toLoadError(cause, id)` (`core/http/http-load-error.ts`).
- Pure core functions signal failure with `missing(...)` / `permanent(...)`, never by throwing.
- Components apply the `Result`, keep one `available` signal (`= result.ok`) and one `error` signal (null for `missing`), and render content or one `wl-load-state`.

## Testing rules (hard)

- **Altitude rule:** test behavior exhaustively at the lowest altitude that owns it. A composite gets exactly one composition test; never re-test shared helpers from slice specs. A service under test is resolved with `TestBed.inject`; protected members are read through the bracket-access loophole.
- **Named constants, never magic numbers or raw ids.** Spell/item ids come from `src/testing/spell-ids.ts`; every computed value gets a named `const` with a one-line derivation.
- **Boundary comparisons are strict** and tested as such: a value exactly at `mean + 2*stddev` is not an outlier - pair the cases.
- **Never load a WCL JSON blob** - build minimal event streams from the factories in `src/testing/builders/events.ts`.
- **Bench fixtures are local to each slice spec**: a small `bench(over: Partial<RotationBench>)` factory that defaults every field and spreads overrides.
- **Presentational leaves:** read `computed()` signals via `mountVm` (`src/testing/component-harness.ts`) - no DOM assertions.
- **Feature components are thin** - their logic is covered by the service spec, not by mounting them.

## E2E rules (for page changes)

- **One WCL analysis per run** - the suite runs in `mode: 'serial'` over one shared `page`, `retries: 0`.
- **Production configuration only** - `playwright.config.ts` serves the production build so slices read ingested files.
- **Static copy exact, computed values by shape or existence** - never pin a number, name, or timestamp that comes from the log or bench.
- **One happy-path test per use-case card**, located by its `wl-*` tag.

## Self-review checklist

Before committing, verify:

- [ ] Every new behavior has a spec at the lowest altitude that owns it
- [ ] Each "triggers" case is paired with a "does not trigger at the boundary" case
- [ ] `INGEST_VERSION` bumped exactly when what ingestion bakes changes: bench shape, measured values, or a republished rulebook
- [ ] Every finding populates `occurrences` (or explains why not)
- [ ] All copy passes the terse-analyst voice rules in **warcraft-writing**
- [ ] `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` pass
- [ ] Templates reach every color through a token, and all formatting goes through pipes
- [ ] Every fallible load returns `Result<T, LoadError>` and renders one `wl-load-state`
- [ ] Every comment the diff adds passes the AGENTS.md gate, audited one by one: it names the concrete mistake a reader makes without it, in one line - summaries, narration, restated code, and fixture descriptions are deleted, not kept

## Verification

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

E2e spends one WCL analysis per run - run `npm run e2e` only when the change touches a rendered page, and read the e2e rules above first.
