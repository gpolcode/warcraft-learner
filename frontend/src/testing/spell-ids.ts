/**
 * Named spell-id constants for tests.
 *
 * The production code never hardcodes spec spell IDs (they come from the
 * rulebook), but tests need *some* stable IDs to wire events to rules. Naming
 * them here keeps specs readable - `Events.cast(SHADOW_BLADES, "0:01")` reads
 * as documentation - and the exact numeric values are irrelevant to the tests
 * as long as builders and rulebook fixtures agree.
 *
 * The Bloodlust family IDs are the real ones the engine recognizes
 * (`BLOODLUST_IDS` in `core/analysis/format.ts`); everything else is a
 * convenient real-ish Subtlety Rogue value used only as a label.
