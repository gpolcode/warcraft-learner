/**
 * Generic, cross-slice WCL-response projections and window view-row builders.
 *
 * These are the small pure functions that several slices projected identically:
 * turning a raw WCL rankings array into the top fetchable parses, and turning a
 * list of spell ids + baked ability art into window header chips. They are not
 * domain analysis - just shape reprojections - so they live here under `shared/`
 * (a blessed cross-slice home, the same way `shared/analysis/analysis-math.ts` and
 * `shared/gear/gear-comparison.ts` do) and each slice imports one implementation
 * instead of re-declaring it. No Angular / `inject()` / IO; pure functions only.

// Recall. Relabel the sentinel to WCL's own Auto Attack art (game spell 6603's icon). A report's
